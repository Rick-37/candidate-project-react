# Atomix - Trial for Frontend Developers (React and TypeScript)
### Focusing on: React and TypeScript skills

## Introduction
This is the second step in our trial for full-stack web developer role who have opted to go for the React path.\
This trial will test you React and TypeScript skills additionally to the frontend skills tested in the [previous trial](https://github.com/atomixdesign/candidate-project-html-css).

## Trial Instructions
To complete this trial, you can use your existing HTML and CSS code from the previous trial to setup a React version of this [site design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/9b96df8b-7468-4806-9b66-1a0cd6e30fa4-cec5/). \
Once that is completed, create a `data` folder and setup individual `.json` files for parts of the homepage content and dynamically fetch the JSON data to the React app.

** Note: We would like to see your TypeScript knowledge as much as can.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn install`

Installs the required packages from the `yarn.lock` file.

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
